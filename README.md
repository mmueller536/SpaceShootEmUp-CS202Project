# Space Shoot 'Em Up
## A CS202 Project Exploring Java

This project, authored by Michael Mueller (thats me!) and Paul Coen, was a collaborative effort made as part of a semester long project in our CS202 project. Me and Paul both decided to go above and beyond and give it our all. While the game is still poorly optimized, as elegant as mud, and was prone to having bugs and weird quirks, the game was a success in our hearts and was a serious accomplishment for lowly freshmen such as ourselves at the time. One day, a revist will be made to optimize the code, but for now, it stands as a living memory of great days working together with a prized colleague.
